# PolyMail
PolyMail is a easy to use mod-mail bot for Discord

This repo is based off an Autocode app ([modmailisfakenews](https://autocode.com/app/lifn/modmailisfakenews)), the original standard lib code remains in the [lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps](https://github.com/lifeisfakenews/autocode-apps)

There are plans for a TypeScript rewrite.
Please expect this around July - August 2024
